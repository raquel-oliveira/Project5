It was on a bitterly cold night and frosty morning, towards the
end of the winter of '97, that I was awakened by a tugging at my            
shoulder. It was Holmes. The candle in his hand shone upon his              
eager, stooping face, and told me at a glance that something was            
amiss.                                                                      
  "Come, Watson, come!" he cried. "The game is afoot. Not a word! Into      
your clothes and come!"                                                     
  Ten minutes later we were both in a cab, and rattling through the         
silent streets on our way to Charing Cross Station. The first faint         
winter's dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the           
occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and          
indistinct in the opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence         
into his heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was         
most bitter, and neither of us had broken our fast.                         
  It was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station and          
taken our places in the Kentish train that we were sufficiently             
thawed, he to speak and I to listen. Holmes drew a note from his            
pocket, and read aloud:
